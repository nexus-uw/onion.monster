<h1>onion.monster</h1>
<div>what is this? onion.monster is my attempt of creating a dynamic dns provider using python + gandi dns. the api is influenced currently by duckdns. additionally there is no signup api so emailing me if you would like an API key + subdomain would be the easiest way forward</div>
